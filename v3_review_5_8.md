# V3 Review - Slides 5-8

Slide 5 (The Foundry): EXCELLENT. Three pricing tiers are clean. Four metric boxes at bottom are clear. The framing "A SaaS Business That Prints Revenue and Deal Flow" is perfect - it positions the education as a business function, not the business itself.

Slide 6 (Defensibility): GOOD. The four moats are clean. Minor issue: the intro text slightly overlaps with the top of the moat cards again. The "Bottom Line" callout now says "venture pipeline" instead of "three-tier economic engine" - much better aligned with the Venture Lab narrative.

Slide 7 (Competitive): EXCELLENT. The table now includes "Deal Sourcing" as a row, which is a key differentiator. APEX OS column shows "$0 (built-in)" vs "$50K+ per deal" for accelerators. Very powerful.

Slide 8 (Market): Clean. TAM/SAM/SOM cards. "Why Now" section now includes "VC Inefficiency" as the third force instead of "Distribution Collapse" - much better aligned.

MINOR FIX: Slide 6 intro text still slightly overlaps with moat cards. Need to push cards down ~20px more.
