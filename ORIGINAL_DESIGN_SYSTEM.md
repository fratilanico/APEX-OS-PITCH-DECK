# Original VentureLab Design System — Key Findings

## Background
- NOT pure black (#08080D). It's a dark navy: approximately #0F1923 to #131B2E
- Has a subtle blue tint/warmth to it
- Gradient teal/cyan bar at the very top of each slide (thin, ~4px)

## Colors
- Section labels: Teal/cyan (#4ECDC4 or similar) — "THE PROBLEM", "THE FOUNDRY", etc.
- Section label has a small underline/rule beneath it in same teal
- Headlines: White, bold/heavy weight (not extra-light like our v4)
- Sub-headlines: Green/teal (#4ECDC4) for emphasis lines
- Body text: Light gray (#C0C0CC or similar)
- Stat numbers in cards: Various colors — red (#FF6B6B) for problem stats, green (#4AFFA0) for positive stats, blue (#4A9EFF) for neutral
- Card backgrounds: Darker than page bg, with subtle border (rgba white ~8-10%)
- Bottom callout boxes: Slightly lighter bg with yellow "Key Insight:" / "The Bottom Line:" labels

## Typography
- Headlines: BOLD/Heavy weight (700-800), not extra-light
- Much larger, more impactful headlines
- Body: Regular weight, good size (~18-20px)
- Section labels: Medium weight, uppercase, with underline

## Cards
- Rounded corners (~12-16px border-radius)
- Subtle border: 1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.08-0.12)
- Background slightly darker than slide bg
- Used for: pricing tiers, stat boxes, moat descriptions, comparison tables

## Layout Elements
- Top gradient bar: thin teal-to-blue gradient across full width
- Bottom callout: full-width card with yellow label + white text
- Footer: "CONFIDENTIAL | APEX OS | February 2026" left, page number right
- Cards arranged in 2x2 or 3-across grids

## What to KEEP from v4 (our improvements)
- All content fixes (financials, CAC story, etc.)
- Real product screenshots
- Founder photo
- Network slide (new)
- No "The Venture Lab" subtitle
- No Kevin Obeegadoo
- Corrected LTV:CAC (18:1 not 9.8:1)
- SAFE + $4M cap deal terms
- Founder voice (not consultant voice)

## What to BRING BACK from original
- Dark navy background (not pure black)
- Top gradient bar
- Card containers for grouped content
- Bolder headlines
- More color variety (teal labels, colored stats)
- Bottom callout boxes
- Footer with confidential + page number
- Overall warmer, richer feel
