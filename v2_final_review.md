# V2 Final Review

Slide 5 is now clean - the intro text no longer overlaps with the moat cards. The text fits in two lines above the cards. All four moats are clearly visible. The "Bottom Line" callout at the bottom is powerful.

All 14 slides verified and ready for delivery. The deck is professional, business-focused, and directly addresses the low-barrier-to-entry concern.
