# V3 Review - Slides 1-4

Slide 1 (Title): EXCELLENT. "The Venture Lab" is bold and clear. Taglines "We manufacture proprietary deal flow" and "We don't compete for deals. We create them." are powerful. Clean, minimal, professional.

Slide 2 (What Business Are We In?): OUTSTANDING. This is the money slide. The question is answered immediately with the blue accent line. The Foundry and The Fund cards are perfectly balanced. The "In one sentence" callout at the bottom nails it: "We are a venture capital firm that has solved its own deal flow problem."

Slide 3 (The Problem): STRONG. "Venture Capital is Broken" frames the entire narrative. The three red metrics (92%, $50K+, 90%) are impactful. The opportunity callout at the bottom connects the problem to our solution.

Slide 4 (Unfair Advantage): EXCELLENT. The pipeline funnel (32,000 → 1,600 → 80 → 8) is very clear. The three metric boxes on the right ($0 sourcing, 32K pipeline, Day 1 revenue) are clean and impactful.

ALL FOUR SLIDES ARE CLEAN - NO LAYOUT ISSUES.
