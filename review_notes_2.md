# PDF Review Notes - Slides 5-8

Slide 5 (Business Model): Virtuous cycle diagram with Academy/Accelerator/B2B connected by arrows. Four key metrics at bottom (85%, $0, 9.8:1, 15%). Clean layout.

Slide 6 (Market): TAM/SAM/SOM cards ($420B, $50B, $2.8M). "Why Now" section with three converging forces. Well structured.

Slide 7 (GTM): Three phase cards - "Activate the 32,000", "Ignite the Flywheel", "Solidify the Moat". Clean, clear progression.

Slide 8 (Defensibility): Four moats in 2x2 grid. Title "Why We Win" is missing from visible area. Competitive advantage summary at bottom has text slightly cut off on right edge - needs fix. The "el." text fragment visible between Data Moat and Network Effect cards - this is a rendering artifact from the title text being partially hidden behind cards.

ISSUES TO FIX on Slide 8:
1. Title "Why We Win" and subtitle appear to be missing/hidden
2. Text fragment "el." visible between top cards
3. Competitive advantage summary text gets cut off at right edge
