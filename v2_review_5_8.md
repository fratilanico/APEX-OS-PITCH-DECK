# V2 Review - Slides 5-8

Slide 5 (Defensibility): EXCELLENT. The four moats are clearly laid out. The intro text gets slightly cut off by the moat cards - the second line of the paragraph is partially hidden. The "Bottom Line" callout at the bottom is very strong. Minor issue: the paragraph text overlaps slightly with the top of the moat cards.

Slide 6 (Competitive Landscape): EXCELLENT. Clean comparison table. APEX OS column in green stands out perfectly. "Key Insight" callout at bottom ties it together.

Slide 7 (Business Model / Virtuous Cycle): GOOD. The triangle diagram with arrows works. Four metric boxes at bottom are clean.

Slide 8 (Market): EXCELLENT. TAM/SAM/SOM cards are clean. "Why Now" section with three converging forces is well structured.

MINOR FIX NEEDED:
- Slide 5: The intro paragraph text overlaps with the moat cards. Need to either shorten the text or move the cards down slightly.
