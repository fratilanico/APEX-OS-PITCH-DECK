# \u2699\uFE0F APEX OS: THE FOUNDER VETTING FORMULA (STARK-V2)\n**Version:** 21eb428_EVOLVED\n**Codename:** NEURAL_HANDSHAKE\n**Status:** ACTIVE\n\n---\n\n## \uD83C\uDFDB\uFE0F THE CORE LOGIC\nThe onboarding experience is designed as a **cognitive high-pass filter**. \nWe don't want \"sign-ups\"; we want **Orchestrators**.\n\n### 1. THE FRICTION CONSTANT\nEvery step is designed to increase commitment and verify founder maturity.\n- **Barrier 1 (Handshake):** Email validation. Disposable or fake addresses are rejected by the terminal kernel.\n- **Barrier 2 (Segmentation):** Explicit choice between Builder (Personal) and Architect (Business). This drives the UI state morph.\n- **Barrier 3 (Vetting):** Mission validation. A minimum of 50 characters is required to prove the user is thinking in systems, not just features.\n\n### 2. THE DYNAMIC UI COEFFICIENT\nThe interface is a **Living HUD** that reacts to the founder's neural profile.\n- **Persona = PERSONAL** $\\rightarrow$ Aura: `CYAN`, Widgets: `VIBE_VELOCITY` + `SKILL_TREE`. Focuses on individual production speed.\n- **Persona = BUSINESS** $\\rightarrow$ Aura: `VIOLET`, Widgets: `MARKET_TAM` + `SWARM_MATRIX`. Focuses on enterprise scale and ROI.\n\n### 3. THE VALIDATION EQUATION\nThe backend evaluator (`Vertex AI`) scores the user based on:\n$$Score = (L \\times 0.4) + (D \\times 0.4) + (A \\times 0.2)$$\n- $L$: Normalized Length ($Chars/200$).\n- $D$: Technical Density (Recognition of agentic and orchestration concepts).\n- $A$: Ambition Level (Long-term market impact vs short-term feature focus).\n\n---\n\n## \u26A1 LINGUISTIC PROTOCOLS (STARK-V2)\nThe JARVIS and Terminal AI follows these rules:\n1.  **Urgent:** \"Identify your objective, Founder. The swarm is idling.\"\n2.  **Impatient:** \"Traditional forms are for the legacy world. Switching to Direct Neural Uplink...\"\n3.  **Sharp:** \"This is a blueprint for a legacy hobby, not a 10-day sprint. Give me depth or give me the exit.\"\n\n---\n\n## \uD83D\uDD11 THE REWARD: GREUCEANU PROTOCOL\nSuccessful synchronization (`ENCRYPTION_KEYS_SWAPPED`) unlocks the secret command `greuceanu`.\n**Payload:**\n- **Access Level:** Restricted Autonomy (Full Module 00 + Module 01 Sneak Peek).\n- **The Vault:** Exclusive Embedded Notion Workspace containing the Founder's Bible.\n\n---\n*Built with APEX OS.
