We have built a **Venture Lab**.

- **The Foundry (SaaS):** A high-margin, zero-CAC talent and idea pipeline.

## Slide 3: The Unfair Advantage

**A captive audience of 32,000 paying customers.**

This is not a lead list. It is the raw material for our Venture Lab.

- **Zero-Cost Sourcing:** We generate a continuous stream of pre-vetted founders at zero cost.
- **Proprietary Data:** We have longitudinal data on every builder, giving us an unparalleled advantage in predicting success.
- **Capital Efficiency:** The SaaS revenue from our Foundry makes our entire operation capital-efficient.

*We don’t compete for deals. We create them.*
