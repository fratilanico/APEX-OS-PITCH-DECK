# V3 Review - Slides 9-14

Slide 9 (GTM): EXCELLENT. "A Surgical Strike, Not a Hopeful Prayer" is strong. Three phase cards are clean. Phase 3 now says "Launch the Fund" instead of generic accelerator language - perfectly aligned with Venture Lab identity.

Slide 10 (Unit Economics): EXCELLENT. Four metric boxes at top. Three-scenario table is clean and readable. The "Note" callout at bottom about Fund returns being additional upside is a smart touch.

Slide 11 (Team): EXCELLENT. Both team members displayed well. Equity Architecture table is clean and readable.

Slide 12 (The Ask): EXCELLENT. $200K prominently displayed. Use of Funds with progress bars + 12-Month Milestones side by side. "What This Investment Enables" callout at bottom ties it together perfectly.

Slide 13 (Risk): EXCELLENT. "Why It Won't Break" title is visible. Four risk cards with italic questions and answers. Competition Risk card directly addresses "What if 30 competitors copy our model?" - exactly what was requested.

Slide 14 (Closing): Need to verify separately but should be the closing slide.

ALL SLIDES 9-13 ARE CLEAN. No layout issues detected.

OVERALL ASSESSMENT: The v3 deck is a massive improvement. The unified "Venture Lab" identity runs through every slide. The narrative is clear: we manufacture deal flow, the Foundry is our SaaS engine, the Fund is our venture engine. The defensibility story is strong. The only minor issue is slide 6 where the intro text slightly overlaps with the moat cards.
