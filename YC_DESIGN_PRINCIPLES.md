# YC Pitch Deck Design Principles (Kevin Hale)

## Core Philosophy
**Investors invest in teams, not slides. Your slides should make your ideas more clear.**

## The Three Rules

### 1. Make it LEGIBLE
- Use large type
- Bold text
- Simple font
- Good contrast from background
- Text at top is easier to read from back of room
- **Test:** Can old people in the back row with bad eyesight read it?

### 2. Make it SIMPLE
- Simple = one idea per slide
- Simple ideas aren't intertwined with other ideas
- Do NOT crowd slides with multiple ideas
- Demo Day decks should have only 5-7 slides (5-7 key ideas)
- Avoid packing in all the nuances - just the core point

### 3. Make it OBVIOUS
- Obvious slides can be understood at a glance
- **Test:** Show it to a stranger - if they don't IMMEDIATELY say your idea, you lose
- Make ideas EXPLICIT - add captions, labels, conclusions
- Avoid information distractions (Hick's Law - more choices = more time to decide)
- Diagrams are "mazes for ideas" - avoid them

## Key Insights

### Investor Attention
- You only have 2:30 minutes
- Investors are EASILY DISTRACTED and IMPATIENT
- If they don't get your point right away, they check email
- Solution: Make slides that can be immediately understood at a glance

### Memory
- People can only remember a few points after a short presentation
- In context of 100 companies, they'll remember 1-2 points max
- **Before anyone can remember, they have to understand**

### What NOT to do
- ❌ Illegible text
- ❌ Complicated multi-idea slides
- ❌ Subtle/implicit messaging
- ❌ Small, thin text at bottom of slides
- ❌ Low contrast
- ❌ Diagrams and complex visuals
- ❌ Packing in nuances

### What TO do
- ✅ Large, bold text at top
- ✅ One idea per slide
- ✅ Explicit captions and labels
- ✅ High contrast
- ✅ Simple visuals or text-only
- ✅ Make conclusions obvious

## Examples from YC Companies

### Bad → Good Transformations

**Shred Video (What we do slide):**
- ❌ Small, light gray text at bottom
- ✅ Large, bold description at top

**Afrostream (What we do slide):**
- ❌ Two ideas + too much text + nuances packed in
- ✅ Short, sweet, easy to recollect one-liner

**Growth graphs:**
- ❌ Just showing a graph
- ✅ Graph + explicit caption: "We're growing 25% month over month"

## Application to APEX OS

Our deck already follows many of these principles:
- ✅ Large, bold headlines (Inter 200, 72px)
- ✅ High contrast (#E8E8ED on #08080D)
- ✅ 10 slides (slightly more than YC's 5-7, but justified for pre-beta with traction)
- ✅ One idea per slide
- ⚠️ Need to ensure ALL text is legible from back row
- ⚠️ Need to make financial conclusions more explicit
- ⚠️ Avoid accent color overuse (creates visual distraction)

## Takeaway
**Legible. Simple. Obvious.**
If you do these three things, you'll do better than 99% of startups.
