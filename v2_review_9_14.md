# V2 Review - Slides 9-14

Slide 9 (GTM): Clean three-phase cards. Good.
Slide 10 (Unit Economics): Scenario table renders perfectly. Pricing tiers at bottom are clean.
Slide 11 (Team): Both team members displayed well. Equity architecture table at bottom is clean.
Slide 12 (The Ask): $200K prominently displayed. Use of funds with progress bars + milestones. Clean.
Slide 13 (Risk): Title "Why It Won't Break" is now visible! Four risk cards render perfectly. FIXED from v1.
Slide 14 (Closing): Need to check separately.

OVERALL: The v2 deck is significantly improved. The defensibility slide (5) and competitive landscape table (6) are the strongest additions. Only minor issue is the text overlap on slide 5 intro paragraph.

The fix needed on slide 5 is cosmetic - the intro paragraph's second line gets partially hidden behind the moat cards. Could shorten the text or adjust spacing.
