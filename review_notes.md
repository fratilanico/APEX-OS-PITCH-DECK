# PDF Review Notes

## Slides 1-4: EXCELLENT
- Slide 1 (Title): Clean, professional, dark theme. "The Economic Engine for the AI-First Economy" - strong.
- Slide 2 (Problem): Three red metric boxes (92%, $2.5M, 18-24mo) - impactful. Root cause callout at bottom.
- Slide 3 (Unfair Advantage): "32,000 Paying Customers. Zero Acquisition Cost." - powerful. Lead quality distribution table + right-side metrics.
- Slide 4 (Solution): "An Economic Engine, Not a Product." - three pillars (Academy, Accelerator, B2B) well laid out.

## Quality Assessment
- Design is clean, minimal, professional - matches the OpenAI style request
- Dark theme with blue/green/amber accents works well
- Typography hierarchy is clear
- Cards and metric boxes are well-structured
- No AI-screaming elements - purely business-focused

## Still need to check slides 5-14
