# V2 Pitch Deck Review

## Slides 1-4: EXCELLENT
- Slide 1 (Title): Clean, bold, professional. "The Economic Engine for the AI-First Economy" - great framing.
- Slide 2 (Problem): Red metrics pop. Root cause callout at bottom is strong.
- Slide 3 (Unfair Advantage): Lead quality distribution table + 3 metric boxes on right. Very data-driven.
- Slide 4 (Solution): Three-tier cards are clean and clear. "An Economic Engine, Not a Product" is a killer headline.

## Still need to review: Slides 5-14
